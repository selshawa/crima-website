      <h2>Research Questions</h2>
      <p>The research is based on three pillars: VKG data modeling, impact chain conceptualization, and integration with 
        <a href="https://www.openeo.org/" target="_blank">openEO</a>.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>How can impact chains be formally modeled within VKGs?</li>
        <li>How can openEO processes be integrated into VKG queries, and which parts should be delegated?</li>
        <li>How can dynamic EO data be semantically linked to VKG instances of impact chain concepts?</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <!-- Workflow section - describes project workflow integrating expert knowledge, VKGs, process graphs, Ontop, users, and data -->
    <section id="workflow">
      <h2>Workflow</h2>

      <p>
        This workflow illustrates the integration of expert knowledge, semantic technologies, and Earth Observation data to support climate risk assessment and adaptation planning.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1. Expert Knowledge</strong> is captured through structured frameworks such as the <em>Impact Chain</em>, representing cause-effect relationships between climate hazards, vulnerabilities, and impacts.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2. Virtual Knowledge Graph:</strong> This conceptual knowledge is transformed into a virtual knowledge graph, allowing it to be navigated, queried, and extended. Semantic web technologies (e.g., ontologies) help link concepts and ensure consistency across data and domains.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>3. Process Graphs:</strong> The virtual knowledge graph connects to process graphs, which define workflows for data processing using platforms like <em>openEO</em>. These workflows automate the generation of climate indicators and other analytical outputs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4. Ontop:</strong> Serves as the data virtualization layer that translates high-level queries into efficient access to distributed data sources, enabling seamless integration between user queries and the underlying data and process graphs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>5. Users:</strong> Users interact with this system through structured or natural language queries, allowing them to assess climate risk, support adaptation strategies, and monitor environmental changes over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6. Data:</strong> The data layer includes satellite imagery, spatial datasets, and derived products that are processed and visualized in the context of the conceptual models, ensuring transparent, traceable, and actionable insights.
      </p>
      <p>
        This approach ensures that scientific knowledge and real-world data are interoperable and accessible to decision-makers, fostering informed climate resilience planning.
