      <p><strong>CRIMA</strong> is a research project focused on building a next-generation decision-support system for climate and environmental risk management. It integrates diverse sources of information such as satellite Earth Observation (EO) data, climate models, scientific literature, and expert knowledge into a single Virtual Knowledge Graph (VKG).</p>

      <p>The VKG enables users to explore and interpret complex environmental risks using intuitive tools. These include AI-powered interfaces that support natural language and structured queries, as well as conceptual models like <strong>impact chains</strong> that help visualize how different risk components are connected.</p>
    
      <p>CRIMA focuses on accessibility for non-technical users, such as local planners and decision-makers. It allows them to ask high-level questions like how a specific region may be affected by increasing drought conditions, and receive meaningful, data-driven answers.</p>
    
      <p>The system is being tested in two real-world application scenarios in the Alpine region. One focuses on hydrometeorological hazards such as floods and landslides. The other focuses on long-term risks related to water scarcity.</p>
